🏦 Bank Management System

A Java (JSE) based console application that simulates core banking operations using Hibernate ORM for database persistence.

This project demonstrates backend development skills, database integration, and layered architecture design.

🎯 Project Motivation

This project was developed to gain hands-on experience with Hibernate ORM and understand how real-world backend systems interact with relational databases.

It helped me transition from learning Core Java to building structured, database-driven applications using industry-relevant practices such as:

- Object Relational Mapping (ORM)
- Session & Transaction management
- Layered architecture (DAO, Service, Entity)
- Clean code structure
- CRUD operations with persistence

🚀 Features
   
   ✅ Create new bank account
   
   ✅ View account details
   
   ✅ Update customer information
   
   ✅ Delete account
   
   ✅ Persistent storage using Hibernate

🛠️ Tech Stack

   - Java (JSE)
   
   - Hibernate ORM
   
   - PostgreSQL Database
   
   - JDBC
   
   - Maven (Dependency Management)

🏗️ Architecture Overview

   The project follows a layered architecture:
   
   Entity Layer → Represents database tables
   
   DAO Layer → Handles database operations
   
   Service Layer → Contains business logic
   
   Utility Layer → Hibernate configuration & session factory
   
   Main Layer → User interaction (console)
   
   This structure improves maintainability, scalability, and separation of concerns.
